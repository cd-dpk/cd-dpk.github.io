Lifecycle roadmap is presented and different types of evolution and maintenanceactivities are placed on it. Status within industry and research is mapped out. Evolution laws are discussed and analyses in different contexts (the traditional, component-based, and open-source). Pre delivery and transition maintenance models are studied and criteria for their success are identified. Impact analysis is studied. Different ways to manage customer problems are surveyed, both the critical (emergency) and non-critical ones. Retirement process model is considered. Finally, the quality attribute "maintainability" is discussed and compared to "bad smells". Techniques for evolutionary design in the small: refactoring. Techniques for large-scale evolutionary design, especially evolution of legacy systems. Architectural patterns for isolation/exposure of change.
